Version 1.0 Released:
---------------------	
	2009-04-14:15   1.0-RC4 adopted as version 1.0 without change.

Changes in version 1.0-RC4: Changes inspired by two anonymous reviewers.	
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	2009-02-04:14   A number of places in which variables were passed
			by value have been amended to pass constant references.

	2009-02-02:13   gslrnginfo has been reimplemented as a singleton.
	                This elimiates the need for some exception handling.
	
	2009-01-27:12	SMC_HISTORY_* and SMC_RESAMPLE_* have been
			replaced with enumerations to allow type checking.
	
	2009-01-27:11 	Missing const qualifiers added to szFile and
			szMessage in the smc::exception class.

			Similarly, for the szName argument to load_data in
			the pf example.

	2009-01-27:10 Makefiles tidied up.
	
	2009-01-27:9 Resampled bitfield in historyflags has been made
			unsigned.

	2009-01-27:8 algorithm header included in sampler.hh to ensure
			availability of max()

	2009-01-27:7 Clumsy mechanism to prevent copying of the
			smc::sampler class removed in favour of the more elegant approach
			of making the copy constructor private.

	2008-11-27:6 A more consistent commenting style has been adopted
			-- C style comments have been eliminated.

	2008-11-27:5 A README.txt file was added, providing a description
			and basic installation details.
	
Changes in version 1.0-RC3:
---------------------------
	2008-08-11:4  Corrected a bug in the RESIDUAL RESAMPLING routine,
			any code using residual resampling should be
			upgraded to at least 1.0-RC3 to avoid potential buffer overrun
			problems and incorrect behaviour. Thanks to Martin Sewell for a related bug report.
	
	2008-08-09:3: Changed the parameterisation of the annealing
			schedule in the rare event example to 
			match that used in the paper.

Changes in version 1.0-RC2:
---------------------------
	2008-08-08:2: Fixed a bug in the resampling routine which could
			lead to incorrect behaviour for certain weight 
			sequences. Thanks to Roman Holenstein for pointing this out.
	
	2008-08-07:1: Added wrappers for additional random number
			generators in smc::rng, specifically:
			Beta, Cauchy, Exponential, Gamma, Gaussian Tail,
			Laplacian and Lognormal distributions.
