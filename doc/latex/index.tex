The S\+MC template class library (S\+M\+C\+TC) is intended to be used to implement S\+MC algorithms ranging from simple particle filter to complicated S\+MC algorithms from simple particle filters to the S\+MC samplers of Del Moral, Doucet and Jasra (2006) within a generic framework.\hypertarget{index_license}{}\doxysection{License}\label{index_license}

The software is still in development but is thought to be sufficiently fully-\/featured and stable for use.\hypertarget{index_using_sec}{}\doxysection{Using the Template Library}\label{index_using_sec}
In order to use the template libary it is necessary to place the set of header files in a suitable include directory and then to instantiate the various classes with the appropriate type for your sampler.

For implementation details, please see the accompanying user guide.\hypertarget{index_example_sec}{}\doxysection{Examples}\label{index_example_sec}
\hypertarget{index_A}{}\doxysubsection{Simple Particle Filter}\label{index_A}
This example provides a simple particle filter for the approximate filtering of nonlinear, nongaussian state space models.\hypertarget{index_SMC}{}\doxysubsection{Samplers for Rare Event Simulation}\label{index_SMC}
The main.\+cc file provides an example of a use of the template library to estimate Gaussian tail probabilities within an S\+MC samplers framework by making use of a sequence of intermediate distributions defined by introducing a potential function which varies from flat to being very close to an indicator function on the tail event.

This example is taken from from Johansen, Del Moral and Doucet (2006).\hypertarget{index_Acknowledgements}{}\doxysubsection{Acknowledgements}\label{index_Acknowledgements}
