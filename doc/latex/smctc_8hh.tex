\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The main header file for S\+M\+C\+TC. 

This file serves as an interface between user-\/space programs and the S\+M\+C\+TC library. This is the only header file which applications need to include to make use of the library (it includes such additional files as are necessary).
